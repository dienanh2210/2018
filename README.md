# Multiplayer Game Unity-Photon

A multiplayer game made with Unity3D and Photon PUN.

**Mechanics:** 1-4 players controls a bar in each corner of a square, keeping a ball bouncing without getting out of the square. If the ball goes out, the player who owns the corner where it happend will be eliminated and his corner is filled with a solid material (the ball cannot trespass is). And so on, until there's only one player left.
